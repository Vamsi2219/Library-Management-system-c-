Library Management System (LMS) using C++ as part of an independent project. The LMS aimed to automate library operations and facilitate efficient management of resources.

Key Features: Implemented a user-friendly interface allowing librarians to add, update, and delete books from the library catalog. Designed a borrowing system enabling users to check out books, with features for tracking due dates and managing overdue fines. Integrated a search functionality allowing users to search for books by title, author, genre, or ISBN. Incorporated data structures such as linked lists and arrays for efficient storage and retrieval of library resources. Implemented file handling mechanisms for persistent storage of library records and user data

Technologies Used: Programming Language: C++ Data Structures: Linked Lists, Arrays File Handling: Input/Output Streams Integrated Development Environment: Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks Version Control: Git

Achievements: Successfully developed and tested the Library Management System, demonstrating proficiency in C++ programming and software development principles. Received positive feedback from peers and mentors for the system's functionality and performance. Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills in addressing challenges related to data management, user interactions, and system optimization. This project showcased my ability to conceptualize, design, and implement software solutions using C++ programming language, while also honing my skills in algorithm development, data structures, and software engineering practices.
